            <h3>Delivery Time</h3>
            <p>We try to keep as many locks in stock as possible, however, when you get into custom items like matching to your specific keyway, we will often have to have these manufactured when ordered. All in stock items will ship within 24 to 48 hours, while custom manufactured items will ship within 12 to 15 business days. If you are ordering locks that require manufacturing, you will be notified of the lead time.
                Our default shipping method is either FedEx Ground (commercial addresses) or FedEx Home Delivery (residential addresses). We also offer FedEx 2nd Day Air for when you need locks right away, however, keep in mind manufacturing times for custom items.</p>
            <p>Additionally, please note that delivery time is also based on "business" days.</p>
            <h3>Shipping Cost</h3>
            <p>We are pleased to offer FREE GROUND SHIPPING on orders over $30 to every keyedalike.com customer. Shipping will be reflected and calculated at checkout.</p>
